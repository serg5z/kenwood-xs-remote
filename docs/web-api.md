# Web Remote preview and HTTP API v0.1

The Web Remote is currently a **read-only preview**. It displays the XS8 service status and available capabilities. Every control button is disabled. The gateway sends only `STATUS` to the local Unix socket; it never sends XS8 control commands.

## Run locally

Prerequisite: Python 3 with the standard library. From the repository root:

```sh
python3 xs8_gateway.py
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` on the Raspberry Pi. The page still loads when `xs8-service` is unavailable and shows the connection failure. Start `xs8-service` separately if live status is needed, and run the gateway as a local user permitted to open its socket. The service's default socket is `/tmp/kenwood-xs8.sock`. Use `--socket PATH` for a different local socket or `--port PORT` for a different port. By default, the gateway binds only to `127.0.0.1`.

## Temporary read-only LAN preview

To open the page in iPhone Safari on the same home Wi-Fi, find the Pi's specific LAN IPv4 address and start the gateway explicitly, for example:

```sh
python3 xs8_gateway.py --bind 192.168.1.20 --allow-insecure-readonly-lan
```

Replace `192.168.1.20` with the Pi's actual address, then open `http://192.168.1.20:8080/` on the iPhone. This mode is **unauthenticated, unencrypted HTTP**. Use it only as a temporary read-only preview on the home LAN. Do not forward the port through the router or expose it to the public internet. The gateway rejects wildcard addresses (`0.0.0.0`, `::`) and requires a literal IPv4 address; a non-loopback address requires the explicit opt-in flag. The flag is rejected with a loopback address to avoid a misleading startup configuration. All controls stay disabled and every POST returns HTTP 501 without accessing the XS8 service.

For authenticated HTTPS on the LAN, use the [nginx setup guide](https-lan.md) and return the gateway to its default loopback binding.

Offline tests (no GPIO or receiver access):

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_gateway.py'
```

## Implemented API

| Endpoint | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/status` | JSON with `gateway`, `xs8_service`, and parsed service `status`. Returns HTTP 503 when the service is unavailable or its reply is invalid. |
| `GET /api/v1/capabilities` | JSON classifications (`supported`, `unverified`, `unsupported`) and explicit `enabled` flags. Only status is enabled. |

`status` preserves the service's `last_gpio_tx`, `last_waveform`, and `receiver_execution` fields. `TX_OK` and `MATCH` do not prove that the Kenwood executed a command. The gateway opens one short-lived Unix socket connection per status request. It does not modify XS8 state.

## Future control API design (not implemented)

The following paths currently return HTTP 501 and do not access the XS8 service:

| Endpoint | Proposed request | Safety condition before implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/v1/source` | `{ "source": "CD" }` (or another documented source) | Validate each source command and receiver state on hardware. |
| `POST /api/v1/mute` | `{}` | Authenticate the caller and report transmission evidence separately from receiver execution. |
| `POST /api/v1/volume/step` | `{ "direction": "UP" }` or `DOWN` | Implement a bounded, atomic step in the single-owner XS8 service. STOP obligation and failure handling must remain server-side; browser release events cannot be the sole stop mechanism. |
| `POST /api/v1/cd/transport` | `{ "action": "PLAY_PAUSE" }`, `STOP`, `PREVIOUS`, or `NEXT` | Validate commands and context before exposure. |

No new XS8 byte values are assigned by this API design. Future iOS clients can use the same versioned JSON endpoints and show capabilities before presenting enabled controls.

## LAN access plan

The direct LAN mode above is a temporary read-only exception. Before adding active controls, return the gateway to loopback behind an authenticated HTTPS reverse proxy, restrict the listener to the intended LAN, and protect every future mutating endpoint against cross-site requests. Browser clients can use a secure same-origin session; a future SwiftUI app can store its credential in Keychain. Do not forward this API to the public internet. Unix socket filesystem permissions remain a separate local access boundary.
